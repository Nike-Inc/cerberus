  *  Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  *  Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

# Making Changes

*  Create a topic branch off of `master` before you start your work.
  *  Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
*  Make commits of logical units.
  *  You may be asked to squash unnecessary commits down to logical units.
*  Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
*  Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages.
*  Please follow existing code conventions when working on a file.

# Submitting Changes

*  Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
*  Submit a pull request to the repository in the Nike-Inc organization.
*  After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
*  Bug fixes or features that lack appropriate tests may not be considered for merge.
*  Changes that lower test coverage may not be considered for merge.
