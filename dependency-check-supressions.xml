            According to https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2018-1258
            Users leveraging Spring Framework 5.x should avoid using Spring Framework 5.0.5.RELEASE.
            Updating to Spring Security 5.0.5.RELEASE+ or Spring Boot 2.0.2.RELEASE+ brings in Spring Framework 5.0.6.RELEASE+ transitively.
            However, users should be certain that other dependency management mechanisms are also updated to use Spring Framework 5.0.6.RELEASE or newer.

            The Groovy LDAP API in Apache allows attackers to conduct LDAP entry poisoning attacks by leveraging setting returnObjFlag to true for all search methods.
            We are NOT doing LDAP with groovy.
