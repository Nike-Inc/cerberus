# The netty leak detection level tells netty how aggressively it should look for leaks of reference-counted objects. See https://github.com/netty/netty/wiki/Reference-counted-objects
# The following are your options (descriptions taken from the documentation page). This will be used to set the io.netty.leakDetectionLevel System property before the server is started.
#    DISABLED - disables leak detection completely. Not recommended.
#    SIMPLE - tells if there is a leak or not for 1% of buffers. Default.
#    ADVANCED - tells where the leaked buffer was accessed for 1% of buffers.
#    PARANOID - Same with ADVANCED except that it's for every single buffer. Useful for automated testing phase. You could fail the build if the build output contains 'LEAK:'.
